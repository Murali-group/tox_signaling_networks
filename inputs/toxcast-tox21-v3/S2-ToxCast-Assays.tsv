This assay endpoint, NVS_GPCR_hAdoRA1, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity.  Using a type of binding reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the binding as they relate to the gene ADORA1.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because the performed assay has only produced 1 assay endpoint.  To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the 'gpcr' intended target family, where the subfamily is 'rhodopsin-like receptor'.	binding	percent_activity	positive	0	2-chloroadenosine	loss	protein	receptor	gpcr	rhodopsin-like receptor	0	10	134	adenosine A1 receptor	adenosine A1 receptor	ADORA1	ADORA1		P30542	1	live	10	134	adenosine A1 receptor	adenosine A1 receptor	ADORA1	ADORA1		P30542	1	live	100|202|215|216	3574492|0|23611293|21251949	NA|doi: 10.1002/ddr.430090202|doi: 10.1021/tx400021f|doi: 10.1016/j.tox.2010.12.010	NA|NA|NA|NA	0|0|0|0	Bruns RF, Fergus JH, Badger EW, Bristol JA, Santay LA, Hartman JD, Hays SJ, Huang CC.

MCP-1 antibody is used to tag and quantify the level of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 protein.

Using a type of binding reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the signaling as they relate to the gene CCL2.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a signaling function.

Eotaxin-3 antibody is used to tag and quantify the level of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 26 protein.

IL-8 antibody is used to tag and quantify the level of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 protein. Changes in the signals are indicative of protein expression changes when conditioned to simulate proinflammation from T-cell Receptor (TCR) activation [GeneSymbol:CXCL8 | GeneID:3576 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:P10145].	single	binding reporter	immunoassay: elisa	regulation of gene expression	Fluorescence	Fluorescence intensity	ELISA	both	antibody	IL-8 antibody	protein	protein-specified	BSK_SAg_IL8_up	1	1	Data from the assay component BSK_SAg_IL8 was analyzed into 2 assay endpoints.

Changes to fluorescence intensity signals produced from an enzymatic reaction [Reaction:CEC + NADPH --> 7-hydroxy-3-cyanocoumarin (CHC) + NADP+] involving the key substrate [7-ethoxy-3-cyanocoumarin (CEC)] are indicative of changes in enzyme function and kinetics for the human cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 [GeneSymbol:CYP2C19 | GeneID:1557 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:P33261].	single	enzyme reporter	enzyme activity	regulation of catalytic activity	Fluorescence	Fluorescence intensity	Fluorescence	loss	substrate	7-ethoxy-3-cyanocoumarin (CEC)	protein	enzyme	NVS_ADME_hCYP2C19_Activator	1	1	Data from the assay component NVS_ADME_hCYP2C19 was analyzed into 2 assay endpoints. This assay endpoint, NVS_ADME_hCYP2C19_Activator, was analyzed in the negative fitting direction relative to Acetonitrile as the negative control and baseline of activity.  Using a type of enzyme reporter, gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the enzymatic activity as they relate to the gene CYP2C19.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a enzymatic activity function.  To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the 'cyp' intended target family, where the subfamily is 'xenobiotic metabolism'.

Changes to fluorescence intensity signals produced from an enzymatic reaction [Reaction:BFC + NADPH --> 7-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (7-HFC) + NADP+] involving the key substrate [7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (BFC)] are indicative of changes in enzyme function and kinetics for the Norway rat cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily a, polypeptide 23/polypeptide 1 [GeneSymbol:Cyp3a23/3a1 | GeneID:25642 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:P04800].	single	enzyme reporter	enzyme activity	regulation of catalytic activity	Fluorescence	Fluorescence intensity	Fluorescence	loss	substrate	7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (BFC)	protein	enzyme	NVS_ADME_rCYP3A1_Activator	1	1	Data from the assay component NVS_ADME_rCYP3A1 was analyzed into 2 assay endpoints. This assay endpoint, NVS_ADME_rCYP3A1_Activator, was analyzed in the negative fitting direction relative to Acetonitrile as the negative control and baseline of activity.  Using a type of enzyme reporter, gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the enzymatic activity as they relate to the gene Cyp3a23/3a1.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a enzymatic activity function.  To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the 'cyp' intended target family, where the subfamily is 'xenobiotic metabolism'.

Changes to fluorescence intensity signals produced from an enzymatic reaction involving the key substrate [CCF4-AM] are indicative of changes in transcriptional gene expression due to agonist activity regulated by the human heat shock transcription factor 1 [GeneSymbol:HSF1 | GeneID:3297 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:Q00613].	multiple	inducible reporter	beta lactamase induction	regulation of transcription factor activity	Fluorescence	Fluorescence intensity	GAL4 b-lactamase reporter gene	gain	substrate	CCF4-AM	protein	receptor	TOX21_HSE_BLA_agonist_ratio	1	1	Data from the assay component Tox21_HSE_BLA_Agonist_ratio was analyzed into 1 assay endpoint.  This assay endpoint, Tox21_HSE_BLA_agonist_ratio, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity.  Using a type of inducible reporter, measures of receptor for gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand the reporter gene at the pathway-level as they relate to the gene HSF1.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a reporter gene function.  To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the 'dna binding' intended target family, where the subfamily is 'heat shock protein'.	reporter gene	percent_activity	positive	0	17-AAG	gain	pathway	pathway-specified	dna binding	heat shock protein	0	161	3297	heat shock transcription factor 1	heat shock transcription factor 1	HSF1	HSF1		Q00613	1	live	161	3297	heat shock transcription factor 1	heat shock transcription factor 1	HSF1	HSF1		Q00613	1	live										3095|3096|3097|3098|3099|3100|3101|3102|3103|3104|3105|3106|3107|3108|3109|3110|3111|3112|3113|3114|3115|3312	Opti-minimum essential media|0.5% dialyzed FBS|100U/ml Penicillin|100ug/ml Streptomycin|1mM sodium pyruvate|0.1mM non-essential amino acids|1500|37|18|Opti-minimum essential media|0.5% dialyzed FBS|100U/ml Penicillin|100ug/ml Streptomycin|1mM sodium pyruvate|0.1mM non-essential amino acids|37|6|485|530 (Channel 1)|409|460 (Channel 2)|CCF4-AM	media_base|media_serum|inhibitor|inhibitor|cofactor|cofactor|media_cell_aliquot|media_temp_celcius|media_time_hr_max|media_base|media_serum|inhibitor|inhibitor|cofactor|cofactor|media_temp_celcius|media_time_hr_max|wavelength_excitation1_nm|wavelength_emission1_nm|wavelength_excitation2_nm|wavelength_emission2_nm|substrate	culture|culture|culture|culture|culture|culture|culture|culture|culture|assay|assay|assay|assay|assay|assay|assay|assay|assay|assay|assay|assay|assay	heat shock

Using a type of binding reporter, gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the signaling as they relate to the gene IL1A.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a signaling function.

BSK_CASM3C	BSK_CASM3C is a cell-based, multiplexed-readout assay that uses umbilical vein endothelium and coronary artery smooth muscle cells, a human vascular primary cell co-culture, with measurements taken at 24 hours after chemical dosing in a 96-well plate.	24	9606	human	vascular	primary cell		coronary artery smooth muscle cells	adherent	microplate: 96-well plate	cell-based	cell-based format	multiplexed	DMSO	0.2	BSK_CASM3C_IL6	BSK_CASM3C_IL6, is one of 14 assay component(s) measured or calculated from the BSK_CASM3C assay. It is designed to make measurements of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, a form of binding reporter, as detected with fluorescence intensity signals by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technology.	IL-6 antibody is used to tag and quantify the level of interleukin 6 protein. Changes in the signals are indicative of protein expression changes when conditioned to simulate proinflammation from cytokines [GeneSymbol:IL6 | GeneID:3569 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:P05231].	single	binding reporter	immunoassay: elisa	regulation of gene expression	Fluorescence	Fluorescence intensity	ELISA	both	antibody	IL-6 antibody	protein	protein-specified	BSK_CASM3C_IL6_up	1	1	Data from the assay component BSK_CASM3C_IL6 was analyzed into 2 assay endpoints. This assay endpoint, BSK_CASM3C_IL6_up, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity.  Using a type of binding reporter, gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the signaling as they relate to the gene IL6.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a signaling function.  To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the 'cytokine' intended target family, where the subfamily is 'interleukins'.	signaling	log10_fold_induction	positive	0	colchicine	gain	protein	protein-specified	cytokine	interleukins	0	175	3569	interleukin 6	interleukin 6	IL6	IL6		P05231	1	live	175	3569	interleukin 6	interleukin 6	IL6	IL6		P05231	1	live	213|214|228|229	19773588|24837663|15208272|15357924	doi: 10.1177/1087057109345525|doi: 10.1038/nbt.2914|NA|NA	NA|NA|NA|NA	0|0|0|0	Houck KA, Dix DJ, Judson RS, Kavlock RJ, Yang J, Berg EL.

It is designed to make measurements of mRNA induction, a form of inducible reporter, as detected with fluorescence intensity signals by Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Capillary electrophoresis technology.	Changes to fluorescence intensity signals are indicative of inducible changes in transcription factor activity. This is quantified by the level of mRNA reporter sequence unique to the cis-acting reporter gene TCF/b-cat, which is responsive to the endogenous human transcription factor 7 (T-cell specific, HMG-box) and transcription factor 7-like 2 (T-cell specific, HMG-box) and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 and transcription factor 7-like 1 (T-cell specific, HMG-box) [GeneSymbol:TCF7 & TCF7L2 & LEF1 & TCF7L1 | GeneID:6932 & 6934 & 51176 & 83439 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:P36402 & Q9NQB0 & Q9UJU2 & Q9HCS4].	single	inducible reporter	mRNA induction	regulation of transcription factor activity	Fluorescence	Fluorescence intensity	RT-PCR and Capillary electrophoresis	gain	inducer	TCF/b-cat RTU	rna	mRNA	ATG_TCF_b_cat_CIS_up	1	1	Data from the assay component ATG_TCF_b_cat_CIS was analyzed into 1 assay endpoint.

Using a type of inducible reporter, measures of mRNA for gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand the reporter gene at the transcription factor-level as they relate to the gene TCF7 and TCF7L2 and LEF1 and TCF7L1.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a reporter gene function.

It is designed to make measurements of mRNA induction, a form of inducible reporter, as detected with fluorescence intensity signals by Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Capillary electrophoresis technology.	Changes to fluorescence intensity signals are indicative of inducible changes in transcription factor activity. This is quantified by the level of mRNA reporter sequence unique to the cis-acting reporter gene Pax, which is responsive to the endogenous human paired box 6 [GeneSymbol:PAX6 | GeneID:5080 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:P26367].	single	inducible reporter	mRNA induction	regulation of transcription factor activity	Fluorescence	Fluorescence intensity	RT-PCR and Capillary electrophoresis	gain	inducer	Pax RTU	rna	mRNA	ATG_Pax6_CIS_up	1	1	Data from the assay component ATG_Pax6_CIS was analyzed into 1 assay endpoint.

Using a type of inducible reporter, measures of mRNA for gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand the reporter gene at the transcription factor-level as they relate to the gene PAX6.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a reporter gene function.

Using a type of binding reporter, gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the signaling as they relate to the gene PLAUR.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a signaling function.

TOX21_PPARg_BLA_Antagonist	Tox21_PPARg_BLA_Antagonist is a cell-based, single-readout assay that uses HEK293, a human kidney cell line, with measurements taken at 24 hours after chemical dosing in a 1536-well plate.	24	9606	human	kidney	cell line		HEK293	adherent	microplate: 1536-well plate	cell-based	cell-based format	single	DMSO	0	TOX21_PPARg_BLA_Antagonist_ratio	Tox21_PPARg_BLA_Antagonist_ratio, is one of 2 assay component(s) measured or calculated from the Tox21_PPARg_BLA_Antagonist assay. It is designed to make measurements of beta lactamase induction, a form of inducible reporter, as detected with fluorescence intensity signals by GAL4 b-lactamase reporter gene technology.	Changes to fluorescence intensity signals produced from an enzymatic reaction involving the key substrate [CCF4-AM] are indicative of changes in transcriptional gene expression due to antagonist activity regulated by the human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma [GeneSymbol:PPARG | GeneID:5468 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:P37231].	multiple	inducible reporter	beta lactamase induction	regulation of transcription factor activity	Fluorescence	Fluorescence intensity	GAL4 b-lactamase reporter gene	loss	substrate	CCF4-AM	protein	receptor	TOX21_PPARg_BLA_antagonist_ratio	1	1	Data from the assay component Tox21_PPARg_BLA_Antagonist_ratio was analyzed into 1 assay endpoint.  This assay endpoint, Tox21_PPARg_BLA_antagonist_ratio, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity.  Using a type of inducible reporter, measures of receptor for gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand the reporter gene at the pathway-level as they relate to the gene PPARG.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a reporter gene function.  To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the 'nuclear receptor' intended target family, where the subfamily is 'non-steroidal'.	reporter gene	percent_activity	positive	0	GW9662	gain	pathway	pathway-specified	nuclear receptor	non-steroidal	0	250	5468	peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma	peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma	PPARG	PPARG		P37231	1	live	250	5468	peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma	peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma	PPARG	PPARG		P37231	1	live	221	21543282	doi: 10.1289/ehp.1002952		0	Huang R, Xia M, Cho MH, Sakamuru S, Shinn P, Houck KA, Dix DJ, Judson RS, Witt KL, Kavlock RJ, Tice RR, Austin CP.

E-selectin antibody is used to tag and quantify the level of selectin E protein.

Using a type of binding reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the signaling as they relate to the gene SELE.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a signaling function.

P-Selectin antibody is used to tag and quantify the level of selectin P (granule membrane protein 140kDa, antigen CD62) protein. Changes in the signals are indicative of protein expression changes when conditioned to simulate proinflammation from histamine and IL4 [GeneSymbol:SELP | GeneID:6403 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:P16109].	single	binding reporter	immunoassay: elisa	regulation of gene expression	Fluorescence	Fluorescence intensity	ELISA	both	antibody	P-Selectin antibody	protein	protein-specified	BSK_4H_Pselectin_down	1	1	Data from the assay component BSK_4H_Pselectin was analyzed into 2 assay endpoints.

Using a type of binding reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the signaling as they relate to the gene SELP.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a signaling function.

This assay endpoint, NVS_ENZ_hTie2_Activator, was analyzed in the negative fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity.  Using a type of enzyme reporter, gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the enzymatic activity as they relate to the gene TEK.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a enzymatic activity function.  To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the 'kinase' intended target family, where the subfamily is 'receptor tyrosine kinase'. Assay was not developed or optimized to detect gain of signal.

TGF-b1 antibody is used to tag and quantify the level of transforming growth factor, beta 1 protein.

Using a type of binding reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the signaling as they relate to the gene TGFB1.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a signaling function.  To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the 'growth factor' intended target family, where the subfamily is 'transforming growth factor beta'.	signaling	log10_fold_induction	negative	0	colchicine	loss	protein	protein-specified	growth factor	transforming growth factor beta	0	319	7040	transforming growth factor, beta 1	transforming growth factor, beta 1	TGFB1	TGFB1		P01137	1	live	319	7040	transforming growth factor, beta 1	transforming growth factor, beta 1	TGFB1	TGFB1		P01137	1	live	213|214|228|229	19773588|24837663|15208272|15357924	doi: 10.1177/1087057109345525|doi: 10.1038/nbt.2914|NA|NA	NA|NA|NA|NA	0|0|0|0	Houck KA, Dix DJ, Judson RS, Kavlock RJ, Yang J, Berg EL.

Changes to bioluminescence signals produced from an enzymatic reaction involving the key substrate [One-Glo] are indicative of changes in transcriptional gene expression due to agonist activity regulated by the human thyroid hormone receptor, alpha and thyroid hormone receptor, beta [GeneSymbol:THRA & THRB | GeneID:7067 & 7068 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:P10827 & P10828].	single	inducible reporter	luciferase induction	regulation of transcription factor activity	Luminescence	Bioluminescence	Luciferase-coupled ATP quantitation	gain	substrate	One-Glo	protein	receptor	TOX21_TR_LUC_GH3_Agonist	1	1	Data from the assay component Tox21_TR_LUC_GH3_Agonist was analyzed into 1 assay endpoint.

Using a type of inducible reporter, gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the reporter gene as they relate to the gene THRA and THRB.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because the performed assay has only produced 1 assay endpoint.

Changes to fluorescence intensity signals are indicative of inducible changes in transcription factor activity. This is quantified by the level of mRNA reporter sequence unique to the cis-acting reporter gene Xbp1, which is responsive to the endogenous human X-box binding protein 1 [GeneSymbol:XBP1 | GeneID:7494 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:P17861].	single	inducible reporter	mRNA induction	regulation of transcription factor activity	Fluorescence	Fluorescence intensity	RT-PCR and Capillary electrophoresis	gain	inducer	Xbp1 RTU	rna	mRNA	ATG_Xbp1_CIS_up	1	1	Data from the assay component ATG_Xbp1_CIS was analyzed into 1 assay endpoint.

Using a type of viability reporter, measures of total protein for loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand the viability at the cellular-level.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a secondary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a viability function.

Using a type of viability reporter, measures of total protein for loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand the viability at the cellular-level.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a secondary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a viability function.  To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the 'cell cycle' intended target family, where the subfamily is 'cytotoxicity'.	viability	log10_fold_induction	negative	1	colchicine	loss	cellular	cellular	cell cycle	cytotoxicity	0																					213|214|228|229	19773588|24837663|15208272|15357924	doi: 10.1177/1087057109345525|doi: 10.1038/nbt.2914|NA|NA	NA|NA|NA|NA	0|0|0|0	Houck KA, Dix DJ, Judson RS, Kavlock RJ, Yang J, Berg EL.
